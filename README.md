# The J Word Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension is designed to help users stay focused by blocking distracting websites. It's particularly aimed at those who are unemployed and trying to be employed, minimizing online distractions.

## Features

*   Blocks a predefined list of social media and other distracting websites.
*   Plays a sound when a blocked site is accessed.


## How to Install

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using HTTPS:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-blocker.git
```

Or, if you have SSH set up with GitHub:

cd social-media-blocker
```

### 2. Load the Extension in Chrome

1.  Open Google Chrome.
2.  Go to the extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and pressing Enter.
3.  Enable **Developer mode** by clicking the toggle switch, usually found in the top right corner.
4.  Click on the **Load unpacked** button, which appears after enabling Developer mode.
5.  In the file selection dialog, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository (e.g., `social-media-blocker`).

The "The J Word" extension should now be loaded and active in your Chrome browser. You'll see its icon (if specified in `manifest.json`) in the Chrome toolbar.
